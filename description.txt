
 Method and arrangement for operating a solar cell array

The invention relates to a method for operating a solar cell arrangement and to an arrangement for carrying out the method.

State of the art

Among the so-called regenerative energies, solar energy is gaining in importance as it has succeeded in reducing the costs of the solar cell modules and the entire plants and increasing the energy yield and thus the total cost per unit generated electrical

To bring energy closer to the values that set the economic standard in energy production based on fossil fuels. In addition to the photoelectric yield of each cell also plays a suitable

Operating mode, especially an optimized mode of decoupling of electrical energy, an important role.

The extraction of power in organic solar cells occurs continuously, since the performance depends only on external parameters, such as irradiation and temperature. The power extraction is therefore done with a so-called maximum power point tracker, which decreases the power invariably in time. This procedure and a corresponding circuit arrangement are described in EP 1 239 576 A2.

In this publication, it is proposed to adjust operating modes previously practiced, such as the duty cycle of a switching converter, as a function of the measured values of current voltage and current measurements and subsequent AD conversion, or to increase the duty cycle Monitoring the switching converter output is tracked so that output voltage or -ström is maximized to go off in the interest of a simplified control.

Disclosure of the invention

According to the findings of the inventors, this results in a sub-optimal power take-off due to the temporal and state-dependent efficiency of the SDSC, and the potential of the cell is not fully exploited. This would result in power losses.

The invention is therefore based on the object to provide an improved method for operating a solar cell array, in particular with organic-based solar cells, and an arrangement for its implementation, which allow the achievement of a higher energy yield over a longer period of operation.

This object is achieved in its method aspect by a method having the features of claim 1 and in its device aspect by a

Arrangement solved with the features of claim 7. Advantageous further developments of the inventive concept are the subject of the respective dependent claims. The invention includes the essential idea of departing from the hitherto practiced principle of "maximum power point tracking", in which the power provided is taken off in a constant manner in time, and further includes the idea of timing the power dissipation in a suitable manner In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, a defined time program of the power extraction is determined beforehand and, according to a first aspect of the invention, a predetermined time program of the power take-off is determined beforehand and then applied a corresponding timing or, according to a second aspect of the invention, a relevant state variable of the solar cell array monitored time-dependent and executed the power control in dependence on the measurement result. It is understood that the proposed arrangement reflects these procedural principles in the form of structural features, ie device aspects.

The invention thus takes into account the temporal, internal variance of organic solar cells. As a result, the cell can be operated for longer periods at a higher power point and the potential of the cell is optimally utilized.

In one embodiment of the invention it is provided that the decoupled electrical power is reduced periodically for a respective predetermined period of time and by a predetermined amount relative to a maximum power value. Specifically, in this case, the periodic reduction can be coupled to a time of day, in particular as a night reduction of the power extraction is performed. Notwithstanding the principle of night reduction, the timing program can be designed so that in a correspondingly operated photovoltaic system, the maximum power is provided at peak demand times, while in periods of lower demand, the output power is reduced.

In this context, it is also possible to modify the timing of the power decoupling in the short term in order, for example, to promptly take into account a shift in peak loads. In this sense, a defined time program does not mean a long-term and immutable predetermined program, but needs-adapted short-term control interventions should definitely be within the scope of the invention, provided that the medium-term control of the power extraction is adapted to the physical conditions of the respective solar cell structure. In a further embodiment of the invention, it is provided that the decoupled electrical power is controlled by temporarily switching the operating voltage to a value suitable for the regeneration of the solar cell arrangement, in particular its open circuit voltage. The suitable voltage value does not necessarily or not even preferentially be the open-circuit voltage, but other values may be found suitable from the structure of the respective solar cell or the boundary conditions of the control. In a further embodiment of the invention, the decoupled electrical power itself is monitored as the state variable and its detected measured value used to control the decoupling. Thus, this embodiment has a feedback aspect and is in some sense a regulation. In principle, other state variables come into consideration as a starting point for the control, which are in a sufficiently direct relationship to the mechanisms of the carrier generation and the power take-off to an external load. This may be, for example, a local increase or a segmental profile of an output current-output voltage characteristic, a surface temperature of the solar cell, and the like.

An embodiment of the proposed arrangements is designed so that the sensor is designed as a power meter for detecting the decoupled power, in particular its instantaneous value. In a further embodiment, it is provided that a threshold value discriminator is connected between the sensor and the control device in such a way that the input signal from the sensor for the control device in FIG

Depending on the overshoot or undershoot of at least one predetermined threshold value of the state variable is dependent. Among other things, a lower threshold may be implemented in the threshold discriminator, so that the power controller responds to a decrease in the current power (in the maximum out-of-range mode of operation). In one embodiment of this embodiment, the threshold value discriminator can be embodied in multiple stages, so that depending on which of a plurality of predetermined threshold values in "maximum operation" is achieved under certain conditions, a different one of a plurality of selectable control programs is activated in each case Operating mode with reduced power extraction back into the "maximum mode", a multi-level threshold discriminator can function meaningful by depending on the actually achieved recovery state of the solar cells either the maximum power point tracking resumed unrestricted or set an operating mode with moderately increased power decoupling.

For the aforementioned and further embodiments, a processor control of the switching control unit with internal or permanently connected control program memory for storing a plurality of control programs in association with certain input values is advantageous. The control programs can be permanently programmed or provided externally, for example via a wired or wireless message transmission from a control unit for solar cell arrangement, or can be changed.

The advantages and expediencies of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description with reference to the figures. 1A and 1B show an exemplary embodiment of the method according to the invention in a graphic representation of the time profile of the voltage and coupled power applied to a solar cell arrangement, FIGS. 2A and 2B show schematic representations to illustrate an arrangement according to the invention, Fig. 3 is a schematic representation of another embodiment of the inventive arrangement and

Fig. 4 is a schematic representation of another embodiment of the invention.

Instead of continuously taking power from the organic solar cell (OPV) module at the maximum power point (V M pp) and neglecting a decrease in power over time, the controller turns the operating point on from the optimum operating point after a certain time t on Regeneration point in order for the cell to recover, cf. Fig. IA and I B.

As a result, the efficiency is raised again to a maximum. This regeneration point is in particular the open circuit voltage (V O c) - At this regeneration point no current flows, so that no power is converted. After a recovery phase t O ff, the working point is restored to the optimal one

Operating point (V M pp) laid.

In Fig. I B is illustrated by dotted or dash-dotted lines comparing how the time profile of the decoupled power (average) is in the proposed mode of operation over the conventional mode (without periodically resetting the operating voltage). It can be seen that the average decoupled power represented by a dot-dash line is higher in the process control according to the invention.

The length of the recovery phase is variable, and may take place, for example, during parts or the entire night. The cell provides maximum performance due to the previous recovery phase. On a performance reduction of the cell with time, the controller can respond optimally due to external inputs (ton, t O ff). However, the controller can also calculate the best possible ratio between on and off state by analysis of the time variations power and adjustment of the switching duration, without external input. On average, the power provided by the circuit operations is higher than that provided by the conventional method. Although power loss occurs through the regeneration phases, this power loss can be overcompensated by the higher operating state. The efficiency ? is calculated accordingly as:

? = P ou Xt)

The control device 15 comprises a microcontroller 15a and a control program memory 15b, which is addressed via the input signal received from the temperature sensor 11 and from which a suitable control program is read out and activated in response to the input variable.

This performs a threshold discrimination of the detected power value with a pre-stored lower threshold and, when it falls below a corresponding control signal to an input of the (modified) control device 3 'on which there causes the activation of a regeneration control mode of the arrangement. As long as the available power does not reach or fall below the lower threshold, the arrangement can be operated in the "maximum power point." The embodiment of the invention is not limited to the examples and aspects described above, but is possible in a variety of variations It is also expressly pointed out that the proposed operating mode is not limited to solar cells of the type mentioned, but in principle can also be useful in photovoltaic systems of other types and other direct voltage sources.
